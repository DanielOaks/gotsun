# GotsunDiary

This is a Go reimpementation of the amazing [tsundiary](https://github.com/neynt/tsundiary). This version's focused on making something that's really easy to just download and run on your machine at home.

Since the goal is for someone to run this at home, there's no multi-user support. Only one user per instance.

I'm making this because it's a fun idea, I really like it, and I wanted to build my own version of it. Major props to [@neynt (Jim Zhang)](https://github.com/neynt) who put the original under the MIT license and has helped me out with contributing back to the original.
